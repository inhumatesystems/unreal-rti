Inhumate RTI - Unreal Engine Integration
========================================

Version 0.0.1-dev-version


Installation
------------

1. In your Unreal C++ project folder, create a folder called `Plugins` if it doesn't already exist

2. Unzip the contents of this package into that directory, so there should be a file with path `Plugins/InhumateRTI/InhumateRTI.uplugin`

3. Open up your project, answer *Yes* if a dialog asks to rebuild plugins, and in the *Edit -> Plugins* menu, make sure the InhumateRTI plugin is enabled for your project.
